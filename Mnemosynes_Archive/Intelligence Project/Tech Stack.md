**Flask** 
- In the beginning I chose Flask, then went to Django because I liked the idea of not having to worry about security.  I liked working with Django, but for now, Flask is better for me since I can work with what I am more familiar with, SQLAlchemy, WTForms,  
**Virtualenv**
- Normally I would go with poetry but I went rouge on this one.
**Flask-Migrate** 
- I set up Flask-Alembic first, but Flask-Migrate was just so much easier and didn't need anything from me. 
**Flask-SQLAlchemy**

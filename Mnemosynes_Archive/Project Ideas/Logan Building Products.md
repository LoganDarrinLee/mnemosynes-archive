This mostly evolved into #projects/in-gen-man.

Logan Building Products would essentially be an API connecting all of the local building product suppliers to one easily managed web app for contractors to manage projects with. 

The money making aspect behind it would either be a tiny markup at the end of the order. A dollar or so would suffice. 

You would search for materials and be able to view prices and options available, add to cart, and we would send the supplier the items you are picking up.

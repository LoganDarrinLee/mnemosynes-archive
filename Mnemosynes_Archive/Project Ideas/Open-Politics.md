#projects/open-politics

### What? 
- An online forum SAAS intended to foster community engagement. 
- I came up with the original idea to give more of a voice to constituents, hold politicians accountable to the wishes of their district, and to give people a platform to educate themselves on community topics. 


### Why? 
At the time of writing this, it is late February of 2025, and Donald Trump is tearing down the foundations of our democracy. I feel powerless.

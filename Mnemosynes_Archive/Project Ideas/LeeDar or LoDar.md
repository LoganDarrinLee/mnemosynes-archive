This one is one of my favorites. 

A sensor system that uses #lidar to map real world terrain and environments into a game engine. 

I imagine it being very modular. Something like a tiki torch you stick into the ground or sit it on a stand would be the sensor. Using a few to stick into the ground and create a perimeter, they scan the area inside and transmit the data to a hard-drive. You generate the terrain on your computer and can plug it into some game engine. 

- I think the bottom of the staff would either be a stake to put in the ground, or some kind of auto balancing legs that adjust to the angle on the ground.

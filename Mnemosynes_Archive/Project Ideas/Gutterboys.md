#projects/ideas/gutterboys 

An online gutter delivery service for the local area. I would use Bill, whose name I have changed, if he is interested. 

The idea is you either text the hotline, or enter it online, the lengths, elbows/accessories. Bill would pick it up and I take a dollar or so per order.

- **Money-Mule**
	- [[Money Mule]]
	- Background game that only takes up a small portion of your screen.
	- Oversee the cash flow for the criminal organization you work for. Purchase legitimate businesses, launder money, payroll, and the routes cash takes to get to your businesses for laundering.
	- Boss has ever increasing quotas you have to deal with ~eye-roll~.

- **MW3 Survival Inspired Game**
	- Taking inspiration from MW3 survival mode, and making a stand alone game about surviving endless waves of enemies. 
	- I would like to add features like commanding NPC soldiers to defend positions, and where to retreat to. 
	- Buy weapons, health, and other equipment to distribute among yourself and allied NPC soldiers.
	- Weapon combat should be more similar to battlefield. I like the idea of a head shot being instant. 
	- Destructible environment.

**Goal:** [[Resource Systems]] #game-dev/rts-game/resources/base-component

Still new to Godot, working through the [[Build Your Own RTS Tutorial]] video, and I am finally starting to work on my own components. I feel confused about where to start, but I have been trying different things based off of the tree system I learned in the video.

I feel confused about the Godot [[Component Paradigm]] and how I can use it to build scenes for resources. I want to make the game as modular as possible so that the logic does not become too overwhelming and remains easy to change over the years. 

I do feel proud of how easy the programming aspect has become. I feel like it has been easy picking up GDScript, and game development seems as if it may be easier than I was thinking it would be. This will likely be an incredible long process still.

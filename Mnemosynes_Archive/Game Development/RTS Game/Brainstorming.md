## Name Ideas

## Scope & Goal
-  I don’t like how overwhelming managing multiple planets in planetary annihilation battles can become. 
- Pixelated graphics? 

## Inspiration
- Civilization V (resources & city building)
- Planetary annihilation (combat, unit production)
- Factorio (resource management and supply chains)
- Tropical storm front (gameplay, unit production, capture the flag/objective )
- Age of empires (idk its a good game I think )
- Stardew valley (graphics)
- Halo strategy game 

## Ideas
- Units need to be supplied with ammo and fuel. 
- Units need to be transported to the front lines.
- Artillery doesn't just blind fire and land shots, they need either a clear sight-line, or some kind of spotter system.
- Units can be customized with modules. I originally was thinking ago it battleships and the types of weapons they can be outfitted with. 
- Air strips that plans take off and bombard from. Maintenance crews for the air vehicles.
- Civilization V inspired resource mines. Units require different materials you need to source. And those factories need to be supplied with materials. 
- Factories can be programmed to build unit groups from a custom work order. Custom work orders can be saved and reused to create x-amount of tanks, y-amount of anti-air, z-amount of maintenance/supply units. 
- Air units don’t just float around, they make their strike run and return to an airfield. 
- Supply chains can be automated so you don’t have to manage them after you set them up. 
- Diplomacy with other countries. 
- Trade with other countries. 
- Build dynamic fortifications, to protect interests. [Castle pack](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/castle-kit), [builder kit](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/building-kit), [modular buildings](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/modular-buildings), [city kit](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/city-kit-commercial),
- I want a war planning system. The picture that comes into my head is a map screen with all of the places you have discovered, and in that screen you can assign missions to your units. I would like to give users the option to build a plan B in case of plan A begins falling apart. Example:
	- You have an infantry brigade, a tank/mech brigade, artillery units, and an airfield with a moderately sized air-force. Your goal is to move through a mountain pass and take a village on the other side.
	- You have an airplane do a quick reconnaissance mission, spotting defenses and troop positions. 
	- Knowing where air defenses are, you plan the following to attack in sequence. 
		- Artillery targets air defenses.
		- During the initial artillery bombardment, air force moves in and targets troop positions.
		- Infantry and mech move through the pass to engage surviving forces.  
		- Ground forces have taken the mountain pass and are fighting the last of the units surrounding the village. 
		- Second wave of air assault takes out key positions in the cit.
		- Ground forces move in, artillery moves up and bombards reinforcements coming in from the rear of the city.
- Logistics.
	- Units automatically created can be transported automatically by your transportation network along with supplies.
	- Trade routes between cities, you need to establish roads/railroads. Resources are only available after transportation.
- Advisors for managing mundane tasks after they are setup.
	- I like the idea of having to establish a system for logistics, but after the initial establishment you should be able to assign someone to manage where resources are sent. 
	- Military advisors can help track battles on other sides of the globe. You can give a general a mission and they will plan and fight against the enemy, while trying to conserve losses.

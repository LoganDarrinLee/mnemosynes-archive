## Planetary Annihilation

#### What did they do that was good or interesting?
- Large scale combat.
- Resource management was pretty straight forward.
- Non combat engineer/worker units that managed construction. 
- A single unit was 'in charge', and on their death the battle was over. 
#### What they could have done better: 
**My Take**
- Too overwhelming, AI was able to exploit what I could not pay attention to. Ex: Hitting my main base during one of my offensives. 
- All metal extractors outside of my main base were taken by enemy AI very quickly. It seemed like they would target production of materials better than they would target my armies. 
**Online Opinions**

	- Key takeaways 
		- Awkward UI
		- Lack of streamlining (especially when streamlining features shown in the trailer didn't appear in the final game)
		- Lack of factions
		- No campaign
		- Steep (at the time) system requirements for lackluster return
		- Bland maps
		- Perceived lack of variety or strategy/lackluster units
		- Devs immediately appeared to dump the game for new projects while the game was incomplete, soured what few fans they had

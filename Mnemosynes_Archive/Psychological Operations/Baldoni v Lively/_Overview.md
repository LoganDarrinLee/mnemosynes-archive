This is a generalization of the events as I understand them. I typically do not have interest in celebrity drama, but this series of events included a disinformation campaign on social media, which I find very interesting.

## The Story
Justin Baldoni *(I had no idea who this was before Callie showed me)*, sexually harassed Blake Lively on set of *It Ends With Us*. He then ran a smear campaign to get out ahead of the coming backlash.

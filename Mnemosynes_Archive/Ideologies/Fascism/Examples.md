## How Fascism Works - Jason Stanley
From this post on r/CleverComebacks [breaks down what Donald Trump Jr. tweeted]() and has this wonderful comment providing examples to spot a fascist movement according to author Jason Stanley "How Fascism Works"

*It should be noted that a fascist doesn't need to make up all of these signs to be considered a fascist.*

1. The Mythic Past
"We" descend from a glorious, patriarchal past; "they" threaten that legacy.

2) Propaganda
The Language of democratic ideals takes on corrupted, opposite meanings. Corrupt politicians run anti-corruption campaigns; freedom of speech claims are used to suppress speech

3) Anti-Intellectual
Universities are branded as incubators of liberalism, Marxism, and feminism. Expertise no longer has any value.

4) Unreality
Facts are debased, and without a common understanding of reality reasoned debate becomes impossible.

5) Hierarchy
Fascist politicians attempt to prove natural divisions between "us" and "them."

6) Victim-hood
Any gains for minorities "them" are a loss for "us."

7) Law and Order
"They" are criminals, lawless by nature and in need of policing.

8) Sexual Anxiety
"We" support and protect the family; "they" are deviant and threatening.

9) Sodom & Gomorrah
"We" come from the rural heartland, the backbone of the nation; "they" live in cities.

10) Arbeit Macht Frei "Hard work sets you free"
"They" are lazy and undeserving; "we" are hardworking.

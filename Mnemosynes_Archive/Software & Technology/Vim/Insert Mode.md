This is the second most used mode, and will be the most familiar behavior to most people. Once in insert mode, typing inserts characters just like a regular text editor. You can enter it by using an insert command from normal mode.

Insert commands include:

- `i` for insert, this immediately switches vim to insert mode
- `a` for **a**ppend, this moves the cursor after the current character and enters insert mode
- `o` inserts a new line below the current line and enters insert mode on the new line

These commands have an uppercase variety too:

- `I` moves the cursor to the beginning of the line and enters insert mode
- `A` moves the cursor to the end of the line and enters insert mode
- `O` inserts a new line above the current one and enters insert mode on the new line

There are so many more ways of inserting text in Vim that canâ€™t be listed here but these are the simplest. Also, beware of staying in insert mode for too long; Vim is not designed to be used in insert mode all the time.

To leave insert mode and return to normal mode, press `Esc` or `<C-[>`
